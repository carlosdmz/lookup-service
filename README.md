# Lookup Service
This is a simple IP lookup service built in Go.
It contains the code for the service itself, local development environment, and a
Helm setup for deploying in any Kubernetes cluster.

## Local environment setup
The setup is done by downloading and installing both Docker, and Docker Compose.
Just bring it by simply typing:

```bash
make localenv-start
```

The API's schema can be found in the `swagger` directory. It really queries for
IP addresses, given a domain name.

## Kubernetes setup
To deploy it in any Kubernetes cluster, you need to build the image:

```bash
make build
```

And then, install the Helm release in the cluster:

```bash
helm install lookup-service ./helm
```

It'll bring up one pod for the service and another for the DB.
